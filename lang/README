Assembly Language Spec for BeeF machine code
===============================================================================
Features:
* namespaces
    * The function block architecture used by BUTCHER allows for function
        "namespaces" of up to 255 functions. Functions occupying a
        namespace may call any other function by name within the namespace.
    * Namespaces can be nested. Nested namespaces occupy one name in the parent
        namespace. Functions in a child namespace can be accessed by functions
        in the parent namespace by stacking the functions child-namespace ID
        under the namespace's parent-namespace ID
* modules
    * Import code from other .cow files
        * Pick functions from one namespace and add them the the root namespace
        * Pick functions from one namespace and add them as a nested namespace
    * preamble and postable
        * Modules which specify a preamble and postamble can be run as
            standalone programs.
        * Preambles prep processor memory by allocating a control cell and
            loading it with the desired "entry-point" function ID
        * Postambles clean up processor memory before the program exits
        * Preamble and Postable routines only run for the root module
* functions and recursion
* debugging
    * automatic cell and stack locking
        * generates error messages at runtime when code violates important 
            conditions

===============================================================================
Syntax:
* syntax is enforced with named curly-brace closures
    * certain names a reserved keywords, and mark the closure as performing a
        a special functionality
    * keywords are only reserved if they would be valid, anywhere else they are
        available for use (but this is discouraged)

* keywords:
    * module:
        * Defines a closure as a module. Module closures must contain a 
            namespace closure, and may optionally contain preamble and postamble
            closures, which make the module closure runnable. Modules may also
            have a depends closure, which lists files containing modules to
            import from
    * preamble:
        * Defines a closure as a module preamble. Preamble closures are run when
            the parent module is run, and are expected to prepare memory then
            call a function in the module namespace.
    * postamble:
        * Defines a closure as a module postamble. Modules running as the root
            executable will run their postamble on exit. Postambles are
            expected to clean up memory from execution.
    * depends:
        * Defines a closure as a dependency closure. Dependency closures list
            files containing modules to import from
    * namespace:
        * Defines a closure as a namespace. Namespaces may contain up to 255
            closures, which must have a namespace-unique name
    * call:
        * Defines a closure as a function call, which contains a path fragment
            to the desired function. The compiler will attempt to resolve
            incomplete paths, but will error if an ambiguous function call ID is
            supplied in the closure.
        * Marks another function within the namespace for execution
        * Calls can stack, with the most recent call being executed first.
    * imports: example IMPORTS library
        * Merges a namespace from another module into a nested namespace
    * if:
        * Defines a closure as a conditional block. Text within the closure will
            be executed if the value at the data head is nonzero
    * else:
        * Defines a closure as a conditional block. Must directly follow an if
            closure. Text within the closure will be executed if the preceding
            if closure is not executed
    * bindings:
        * Bindings are direct text substitutions, and are associated at the
            module level. Bindings which appear in function code will be 
            resolved to the symbols they are bound to.
        * Bindings may contain function calls, but this practice is discouraged,
            as COW function calls are not immediately invoked, and may cause 
            confusion if they are packed into bound keywords
    * binds: 
        * Import bindings from another module. Function calls within the binding
            are resolved to the proper scope.

LANGUAGE ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
* makes use of one "control cell" at position 0

Instruction Layout:
<preamble> [ <header block> <functional blocks> <footer block>] <postamble>
===============================================================================
Preamble:
* sets up memory for functional block execution
    * makes room for control cell (if necessary) by shifting starting cells
    * "bootloader": configures control cell to execute program entry point
        * pushes a 0 onto stack (for program exit)

===============================================================================
Header Block:
* currently doesn't do anything

===============================================================================
Counting Functional Block: 
* basic building block for function call structure
* each block decrements the control cell if it is nonzero
    * block which "zeroes" control cell is executed
    * subsequent blocks will see "zeroed" control cell and skip execution

Functional Block Prototype:
^                       push cc to stack for breathing room
[                       block container (skipped if cc is zeroed)
    _-^                 decrement cc and push back to stack
    >^[-]+^             save adjacent cell, then set to one and push to stack
    <                   return to cc 
    [                   skip block 1: skipped if cc is (now zero)
        _[-]^           overwrite stacked one to zero
    ]                 
    _                   pull stacked value (one if cc was zero, zero ow)
    >_<                 restore adjacent cell
    [                   skip block 2: skipped if cc was not zero
        >
* FUNCTION CODE GOES HERE *
        <[-]            zero cc (exit skip block 2)
    ]
                        (exit container)
]_                      restore cc


Function Call Prototype:
* within skip block two, the stack top is control cell
    * we can overwrite this value if the target funcion has a higher call ID
        * run two functions in one control loop (efficiency!)
        * assembler can calculate offset and write correct value to stack
    * otherwise, do some stack magic to properly branch control flow
        * abuse the fact that cc will always be zero
            * we can use cc as free scratch space, which lets us manipulate
                the stack
            1) pop the saved cc
            2) push our own call ID
            3) push successor call ID
            4) push a zero
            * pushed zero will be popped as control cell at end of func block
            * next call ID will be loaded from stack in exec loop footer
            * skip step 2 for context handoff


===============================================================================
Footer Block:
* unpacks function call ID from stack
    * function call ID of 0 will exit control loop and execute postamble
        * functions which fail to push new call IDs will "pop" to lower
            execution context (context exit)
        * lowest execution context pushed by preamble, exits program
    * branching implemented by pushing new function call ID
        * current control context is passed to called function
    * branch-and-link implemented by pushing new call ID and own call ID
        * "creates" new execution context
        * control returns to caller function when context "exits"


* namespace is a dictionary of named closures
    * imported modules should be merged with the importing namespace
        * call imported_namespace.update(next_namespace), which gives modules
            imported "later" higher precedence in the case of name collisions
    * merge process:
        * namespace must resolve all dependencies from its own scope into a 
            nested scope

* function calls create a directional dependency from the caller to the callee
    * each namespace maintains a dictionary of accessible named closures
    * each function maintains a set of names it is dependent upon
    * imported namespaces should be resolved completely before 
        resolving importing namespaces
    * resolved namespaces "export" a token for each function they contain, which
        is associated with a set of tokens in the layer that it depends upon,
        and a set of tokens depended on for each nested layer visible 
        from the namespace
    * dependency tree pruning starts at the root of the dependency tree, which 
        is the base module's preamble text
        * the base module's preamble may call one of more functions in the base 
            namespace
            * the token-dependency sets of these called functions are combined
                to form a single token "layer" for the base namespace
            * for each nested or imported namespace, a token-dependency set
                is generated from the importing layer
            * each nested namespace is then resolved into a layer, using the 
                importer's token-dependency set
    * calls to other functions in the same scope will merge callee set into caller set
    * nested dependencies should be resolved recursively
    * end goal: each namespace layer should be represented as a single subset of 
        named closures in the namespace
